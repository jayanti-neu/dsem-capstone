SVM:

(Verse 1)
In the world of data, where patterns hide,
Comes a model strong, with clarity as its guide.
Support Vector Machine, it's its name,
To untangle the chaos, it aims its aim.

Linear separability, its starting line,
Where classes divide, in a straight, clear sign.
In high-dimensional space, it takes its stride,
Where features abound, and dimensions wide.

(Chorus)
Support Vector Machine, oh its grace,
In the realm of learning, it finds its place.
With kernels and margins, it finds its way,
Bringing clarity to the data's sway.

(Verse 2)
In sparsity, it thrives, where features sparse,
In text and images, it takes charge.
Non-linear terrains, it doesn't fear,
With kernel magic, it brings answers near.

But with great data size, it has its bound,
For large datasets, it's not as sound.
In its realm, it reigns supreme,
Support Vector Machine, in learning's scheme.

(Bridge)
To novices in data's labyrinth deep,
SVM beckons, with promises to keep.
Linear or non-linear, it knows its role,
In the symphony of data, it finds its soul.

Decision trees and logistic regression,
They too have merit, in the learning session.
But SVM, with its unique art,
Brings clarity, where data's paths depart.

(Chorus)
Support Vector Machine, oh its grace,
In the realm of learning, it finds its place.
With kernels and margins, it finds its way,
Bringing clarity to the data's sway.

(Outro)
So to all who journey in data's song,
SVM awaits, to help them along.
In the dance of patterns, it finds its beat,
Support Vector Machine, making data neat.
