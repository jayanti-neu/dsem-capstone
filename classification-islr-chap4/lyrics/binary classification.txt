binary classification:


(Verse 1)
In the world of prediction, where data reigns supreme,
Binary classification, it's quite the dream.
Logistic Regression steps into the light,
With linear combos, it takes its flight.

Coefficients, they weigh each feature's might,
Mapping inputs to outcomes, day and night.
But how do we find these weights just right?
Maximum Likelihood, it's our guiding light.

(Chorus)
Logistic Regression, oh so clear,
Predicting outcomes, year after year.
With math and stats, it tells its tale,
In the land of prediction, it sets its sail.

(Verse 2)
Likelihood functions, they paint the scene,
Estimating parameters, like in a dream.
But what about the errors, how do we clean?
Cost functions guide us, like a stream.

Gradient descent, it's the hero's call,
Optimizing weights, both big and small.
With every iteration, we stand tall,
Converging to solutions, we give our all.

(Chorus)
Logistic Regression, oh so clear,
Predicting outcomes, year after year.
With math and stats, it tells its tale,
In the land of prediction, it sets its sail.

(Bridge)
But beyond this tale, there's more to find,
Other models dance, in the data's mind.
Support Vector Machines, they draw the line,
Separating classes, it's quite divine.

Decision Trees, they branch and grow,
Dividing data, row by row.
Random Forests, they stand strong,
Ensembles of trees, where they belong.

(Chorus)
Logistic Regression, oh so clear,
Predicting outcomes, year after year.
With math and stats, it tells its tale,
In the land of prediction, it sets its sail.

(Outro)
So in the realm of binary classification,
Models abound, with their own equation.
Each tells a story, in its own right,
In the symphony of data, shining bright.
