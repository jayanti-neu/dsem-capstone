metrics:
(Verse 1)
We built a model, a champion so keen,
Can it sort the emails, the spam from pristine?
But how do we judge it? Is accuracy king?
There's more to the story, a deeper thing.

(Chorus)
Model assessment, the test it must face,
On unseen data, revealing its grace.
The confusion matrix, a table so grand,
Shows where the model lands, with each classified strand.

(Verse 2)
True positives shine, the good ones it finds,
Spam caught in the filter, leaving peace of mind.
True negatives slumber, the normal mail's rest,
Correctly ignored, putting worries to the test.

(Pre-Chorus)
But errors can creep in, a story untold,
False positives awaken, good mail turned to bold.
False negatives lurk, the sneaky, the sly,
Spam messages slipping through, a reason to cry.

(Chorus)
From this matrix magic, metrics arise,
Accuracy's compass, a truth in disguise.
How many right overall, a basic decree,
But a deeper analysis, sets our model free.

(Verse 3)
Precision, a measure, of positives true,
Out of all it flagged, how many ring true?
Recall, the flip side, how well it can find,
All the spam in the inbox, leaving none behind.

(Pre-Chorus)
Specificity whispers, the negatives right,
The normal emails, classified with such might.
F1 score, a balance, a number so wise,
Combining precision, with recall in its eyes.

(Chorus)
But the story unfolds, with a graphical guide,
The ROC curve emerges, where truth can't hide.
True positive rate climbs, as false positives fall,
The trade-off depicted, a story for all.

(Verse 4)
High AUC signifies, a model that gleams,
Separating classes, fulfilling its dreams.
The area under the curve, a powerful score,
Tells us how well it discriminates, wanting ever more.

(Bridge)
Thresholds play a role, a line in the sand,
Shifting it changes, the metrics at hand.
A lower threshold, catches more spam,
But risks good mail getting lost, a model's big dam.

(Verse 5)
The ROC empowers, the sweet spot to find,
Balancing sensitivity, with a specific mind.
Is catching all spam more important you see?
Or protecting good mail, a crucial decree?

(Chorus)
Model assessment, a crucial design,
Ensuring our models, truly can shine.
Confusion matrix, the metrics we hold,
The ROC curve's guidance, a story unfolds.

(Outro)
So next time you build a model, and let it take flight,
Remember evaluation, to make your work right.
Metrics the compass, the ROC a guiding star,
Leading your model onward, reaching ever so far.
Assessment's the key, to unlocking success,
Building better models, putting knowledge to the test.
