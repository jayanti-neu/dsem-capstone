roc auc:
(Verse 1)
Built a classifier, a model so keen,
Can it tell tumors from healthy, a medical scene?
But how do we find the balance, the threshold so fine?
Too high, good cases missed, too low, false positives whine.
Enter ROC and AUC, a powerful crew,
Guiding the threshold choice, a story brand new.

(Chorus)
ROC, the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve,
True positive rate versus false positive, a story to observe.
AUC, the Area Under the Curve, a score to behold,
Measures discrimination, balancing what's told.

(Verse 2)
Imagine a threshold, a line in the sand,
Anything above it, classified as the target land.
True positives, the cancers we catch, a victory song,
But false positives lurk, where they don't belong.

(Pre-Chorus)
Think healthy tissue flagged, unnecessary fright,
A model's mistake, needing to set things right.
The ROC captures this tension, the delicate dance,
Between catching the good ones, and giving a chance
To the imposters who sneak in, disguised in the fold,
The higher the curve, the better the story unfolds.

(Chorus)
ROC paints a picture, a visual guide,
True positive rate soaring, as false positives slide.
The closer the curve hugs the top, a flawless machine,
Every true positive caught, a classification dream.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(Verse 3)
But real models are fallible, the curve dips and bends,
The AUC, the Area Under the Curve, where the story transcends.
A perfect model, a flawless machine,
Would have an AUC of one, a classification dream.

(Pre-Chorus)
Imagine the ROC soaring, hugging the top line,
Every true positive caught, no false positives to whine.
But the AUC captures the gap, where the story's not done,
The higher the score, the better the battle is won.

(Chorus)
A higher AUC signifies, a model more bright,
Discriminatory power, shining ever so light.
It separates the classes, with greater finesse,
Less confusion and noise, a world we can bless.

(Bridge)
But thresholds play a role, a strategic call,
Shifting the line can change, how the metrics enthrall.
A low threshold catches more, but false positives rise,
A high threshold filters them, but some good ones miss the skies.

(Verse 4)
The ROC curve empowers, to choose the right fight,
Balancing sensitivity, with specificity's might.
Sensitivity, or recall, how well it finds all,
The good guys it catches, never letting them fall.

(Pre-Chorus)
Specificity whispers, the negatives true,
The ones it rejects, that shouldn't come through.
The ROC helps us navigate, this delicate quest,
Finding the sweet spot, where performance is best.

(Chorus)
So next time you build a model, to classify and sort,
Remember ROC and AUC, a valuable court.
They paint a clear picture, of strengths and of flaws,
Guiding you towards a model, that deserves applause.

(Outro)
From curves to single scores, a story untold,
ROC and AUC, their magic unfolds.
Unlocking performance, with a data-driven view,
Building better models, with knowledge shining true.
