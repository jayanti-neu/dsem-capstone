LDA :
(Verse 1)
Listen up, gotta learn about some models so keen,
Generative models, the name of the scene.
Unlike their cousins, the discriminative kind,
These don't just draw lines, they dive deeper, you'll find.

(Chorus)
They learn the whole story, the distributions within,
Probabilities for each class, where the data fits in.
LDA's the first up, a classic so bright,
Multivariate Gaussian, a bell curve takes flight.

(Verse 2)
It pictures each class as a cloud, nice and round,
Assumes the spread's equal, no funky shapes found.
Then it hunts for boundaries, a line nice and clear,
Separating classes, minimizing their fear.
Maximize the distance, that's the key we hold,
Classes far apart, a story untold.

(Chorus)
But the world's more complex, distributions can bend,
QDA steps in next, a more flexible friend.
It loosens the grip, lets each class have its say,
Unique covariances, paving a brand new way.
Circles or ellipses, the data can roam,
QDA captures the shapes, making predictions at home.

(Bridge)
Now both LDA and QDA, they're clever and wise,
Using Bayes' theorem, a truth that never lies.
It takes prior knowledge, what we know from the start,
Combines it with data, a masterpiece of art.
Calculates the odds, the posterior's the name,
The chance you belong, a probability game.

(Chorus)
So instead of a label, a hard line to draw,
They give you a spectrum, respecting the law
Of uncertainty's reign, the world's not in black and white,
Probabilities whisper, guiding you through the night.

(Outro)
Generative models, with Bayes by their side,
Unlocking the secrets, where data can hide.
From Gaussians to freedom, the shapes come alive,
These models keep learning, so let knowledge thrive!
