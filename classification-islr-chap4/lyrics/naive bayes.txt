naive bayes:
(Verse 1)
We've built a classifier, a model so keen,
To predict what lurks, in unseen scenes.
But how does it work? What magic's inside?
Naive Bayes steps forth, with a probabilistic stride.

(Chorus)
Its main goal in classification, a purpose refined,
Is to assign new instances, to the most likely kind.
Using Bayes' theorem, a truth long revered,
It calculates probabilities, a story unsheathed.

(Verse 2)
Imagine an email, spam or not the quest,
Words like "free" and "urgent," a flag for the test.
Naive Bayes classifies, based on these features' might,
Determining the class, with a probabilistic light.

(Pre-Chorus)
It calculates the chance, of the email being spam,
By looking at each word, and the story it can ram.
Is "free" a spammy word? Does "urgent" raise a brow?
These features, independent, a tale to somehow...

(Chorus)
...decipher the truth, with a probabilistic art,
Assuming independence, a key playing its part.
Each word's influence, on the class it might hold,
Treated in isolation, a story untold.

(Verse 3)
This assumption, though simple and strong,
Can sometimes go wrong, where features belong
Together, influencing fate, a story entwined,
Not truly independent, a weakness we find.

(Pre-Chorus)
But despite this caveat, Naive Bayes shines bright,
Especially with vast data, a computational delight.
Fast and efficient, for features galore,
High-dimensional spaces, it tackles and explores.

(Chorus)
Gaussian for continuous, a smooth, flowing tide,
Like email length measured, where numbers reside.
Multinomial steps in, for features discrete,
Counting word occurrences, a pattern so sweet.
Bernoulli for binary, a presence or lack,
"Urgent" in the subject, a single-minded track.

(Verse 4)
Naive Bayes, a warrior, with strengths to behold,
Easy to implement, a story unfolds.
But remember the weakness, the features' embrace,
Their true independence, a concept to chase.

(Outro)
So next time you face a task, of classification's kind,
Consider Naive Bayes, a method you'll find,
Simple and powerful, with a trade-off to make,
But for vast data's challenges, a solution to take.
